This CLI framework is based on [`sploitkit`](https://github.com/dhondta/sploitkit) and is an attempt to gather hacking techniques and exploits especially focused on drone hacking. For the ease of use, the interface has a layout that looks like Metasploit.

Currently, it only supports very few models of drones but we hope to welcome contributions in a near future.
